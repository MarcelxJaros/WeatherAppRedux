            About me: I really enjoy working on frontend development and have a strong passion for learning about new technologies
            in the field. I've gained experience with JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and even SharePoint. I've been fortunate to
            work with these technologies and have found them quite interesting. I also have a creative side and a good sense of
            visual design, which I believe adds value to my work. I genuinely enjoy collaborating with others and being a part of
            a team. I believe that being a team player is important for producing great results and I'm always open to learning
            from my colleagues.
